### Refining your Results

* Use the WHERE clause to refine your query results.
* Use the wildcard character (%) as a substitute for unknown characters in a pattern.
* Use BETWEEN ... AND ... to specify a range of numbers.
* Sort query results into ascending or descending order, using the ORDER BY clause to specify the column to sort on.
* Group query results by using the GROUP BY clause. 


### Functions, Multiple Tables, and Sub-queries

* Most databases come with built-in functions that you can use in SQL statements to perform operations on data within the database itself.
* When you work with large datasets, you may save time by using built-in functions rather than first retrieving the data into your application and then executing functions on the retrieved data.
* Use sub-queries to form more powerful queries than otherwise.
* Use a sub-select expression to evaluate some built-in aggregate functions like the average function. 
* Derived tables or table expressions are sub-queries where the outer query uses the results of the sub-query as a data source.
