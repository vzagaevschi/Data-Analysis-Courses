# Exercise 2 Solutions: Aggregate Functions

**Query A1:** Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
`select SUM(COST) from PETRESCUE;`
**Query A2:** Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM\_OF\_COST.
`select SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST from PETRESCUE;`
**Query A3:** Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.
`select MAX(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE;`
**Query A4:** Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
`select AVG(COST) from PETRESCUE;`
**Query A5:** Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog.
*Hint - Bear the cost of rescuing one dog on one day, which is different from another day. So you will have to use an average of averages.*
`select AVG(COST/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Dog';`

# Exercise 3 Solutions: Scalar and String Functions

**Query B1:** Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.
`select ROUND(COST) from PETRESCUE;`
**Query B2:** Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
`select LENGTH(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;`
**Query B3:** Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
`select UCASE(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;`
**Query B4:** Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.
`select DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) from PETRESCUE;`
**Query B5:** Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use **cat** in lower case in the query.
`select * from PETRESCUE where LCASE(ANIMAL) = 'cat';`

# Exercise 4 Solutions: Date and Time Functions

**Query C1:** Enter a function that displays the day of the month when cats have been rescued.
`select DAY(RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Cat';`
**Query C2:** Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.
`select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where MONTH(RESCUEDATE)='05';`
**Query C3:** Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 14th day of the month.
`select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where DAY(RESCUEDATE)='14';`
**Query C4:** Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.
`select (RESCUEDATE + 3 DAYS) from PETRESCUE;`
**Query C5:** Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between today’s date and the recue date.
`select (CURRENT DATE - RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE;`
